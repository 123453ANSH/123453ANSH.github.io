## The Beginning

Hi! This post marks the launch of my personal website; the launch of this site is the start of a big journey for me. It's, in my eyes, the official start of my pursuit to make a nontrivial *positive* dent in the world. This site will serve as the official document of my mission, and I'm super excited for what's in store. I hope to use this and future posts as a way to express and communicate ideas I feel are important, or talk about things I am passionate about! Irrespective of the direction these articles and the rest of this website goes, I hope you stick with me for the ride :).
